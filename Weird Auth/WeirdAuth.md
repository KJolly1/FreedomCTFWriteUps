# Weird Auth

Website: https://webexploit.freedomctf.org/_/URLI/

Question: I see some URLs logged on the console but donâ€™t know how they are performing the authentication. I heard some people use the URL authentication to hide forms.

Hint: HTTP Get Request

Once you Inpsect Element, click on the "Sources" tab, and there you will see on line 14 it says, "<script>console.log('/_/URLI/dashborad')</script>."

!['Sources'](./Sources.png)

Type that into the URL.

!['NewURL'](./NewURL.png)

Then you will see it says, "Sorry only authorized users are allowed." So change the URL to say https://webexploit.freedomctf.org/_/URLI/dashboard?user=admin&password=admin. It will then return the flag, flag{URL_HAS_LOT_OF_INFO}.
